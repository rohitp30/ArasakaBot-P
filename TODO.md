# TODO

## Sentry
- fully integrate sentry error logging with commands
- feedback command?
- add span support to sub-processes (functions)
- add breadcrumb support
- add user context support

## Commands/Cleanup
### focus on longevity and maintainability
- remove unused commands
- remove unused db tables
- clean up main it looks ugly again
- port RobloxClient to a class
- remove bot permit? not really needed anymore
- system status command & maintenance mode
- revamp discord â†” roblox profile linking (it's a mess rn and idek how it's not bricked yet)
  - specifically /xp view since the bot time to time doesn't find the user
  - maybe centralize all reciprocal linking with one big system/class. (rn there's multiple seperate functions that do the same thing)

...some more ideas that've escaped me
