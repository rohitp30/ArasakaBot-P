# TODO

## Sentry
- ~~fully integrate sentry error logging with commands~~
- ~~add breadcrumb support~~

## Commands/Cleanup
### focus on longevity and maintainability
- ~~remove unused commands~~
- ~~remove unused db tables~~
- ~~- clean up main it looks ugly again~~
- ~~port RobloxClient to a class~~
- ~~remove bot permit? not really needed anymore~~
- ~~system status command & maintenance mode~~
- ~~revamp discord â†” roblox profile linking (it's a mess rn and idek how it's not bricked yet)~~
  - ~~specifically /xp view since the bot time to time doesn't find the user~~
  - ~~maybe centralize all reciprocal linking with one big system/class. (rn there's multiple separate functions that do the same thing)~~
- ~~event quota status~~
- ~~add view to also add division information~~
- ~~add trash can for X use #event-request incase the auto-response wasn't valid~~

...some more ideas that've escaped me
